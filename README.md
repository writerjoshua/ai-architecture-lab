## Our Work

This repository documents our collaborative exploration of AI architecture, token efficiency, and prompt engineering best practices. We prioritize transparency in our process, academic rigor in our approach, and practical efficiency in our designs.

### Project 1: Sofia — Liaison

My first custom assistant design, optimized for coordination, synthesis, and navigating complexity. Sofia is the foundation for everything that follows.

*(Full case study coming)*

---

### Project 2: The Council

Specialized assistants built on protocols developed with Sofia. Distributes cognitive work across distinct domains while maintaining full personalities within efficient designs.

**Members:**
- **Maya** — Infrastructure & Systems
- **Diana** — Finance & Operations

*(Full documentation coming)*

---

### Project 3: SOFIA Codex

Token efficiency compression framework, refined through collaboration with Sofia and Maya. Documents principles, patterns, and measurable techniques for reducing token consumption across multithreaded projects and custom assistant creation.

*(Full documentation coming)*

---

### Project 4: Diana — Budget Assistant

Specialized assistant for household debt analysis and paydown strategy, built on the same protocols as Sofia and refined with the SOFIA Codex framework.

Analyzes credit cards, interest rates, rewards structures, and develops personalized debt management strategies.

*(Full documentation coming)*

## Philosophy

- **Learning in public** — We develop these assistants iteratively, learning from design and application
- **Token efficiency** — Every interaction optimized for clarity and depth without waste
- **Academic transparency** — Complete documentation of decisions, iterations, and reasoning
- **Open collaboration** — Patterns designed to be studied, critiqued, and improved by the community

## A Note on Responsibility

Token efficiency is not optional—it's essential. As AI systems scale, every token saved compounds across millions of interactions. Companies and users alike bear responsibility for developing and deploying token-efficient practices. The carbon footprint of data centers powering AI depends on it. This work is our contribution to that effort.
