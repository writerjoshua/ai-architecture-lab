# AI Architecture Lab

A transparent portfolio of AI experiments and architectural patterns built with [Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai).

**Author:** Joshua Lucero | [connect@writerjoshua.com](mailto:connect@writerjoshua.com)  
**License:** MIT  
**Focus:** Specialized assistant design, prompt engineering, and system coordination with Claude Haiku 4.5

## What is The Council?

The Council is an experimental framework of coordinated, specialized AI assistants designed to explore how Claude can be optimized for distinct domains and work styles. Each member has a carefully crafted personality, expertise, and communication pattern.

- **Sofia** — Liaison and coordinator. Understands the big picture and orchestrates between specialists.
- **Maya** — Infrastructure and systems. Backend thinking, scalability, production-grade solutions.
- **Diana** — Finance and operations. Strategic thinking, resource optimization, analytical depth.

This repository documents the design, conversations, and deployments of this system.

## Repository Structure
```

├── the-council/
│   ├── sofia/              # Liaison & Coordinator
│   ├── maya/               # Infrastructure & Systems

└── README.md (you are here)
```

Each assistant directory contains:

- **profiles/** — Detailed profile README describing personality, expertise, and communication style
- **threads/** — Archived conversations and blog post analysis
- **documents/** — Artifacts created during sessions (prompts, analysis, code, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Explore the Experiments

Start with the profiles to understand each assistant's design:

- [Sofia Profile](the-council/sofia/profiles/README.md)
- [Maya Profile](the-council/maya/profiles/README.md)
- [Diana Profile](the-council/diana/profiles/README.md)

Then browse the **threads** and **documents** to see them in action.

---

## Philosophy

This work emphasizes:

- **Transparency** — Complete visibility into how these assistants are designed and deployed
- **Experimentation** — These are learning projects, not production systems
- **Reproducibility** — Anyone should be able to understand and recreate these patterns
- **Mental Models** — Focus on *why* certain patterns work, not just *that* they work
